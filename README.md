# Horiseon Code Refactored by Clayton Goff
# Horiseon_home
​# https://clayto30.github.io/Horiseon_home/#search-engine-optimization

## Description 
​
<P>My initial repository was GitHub.com/Clayton30/Horiseon. On this repo, my css got so out of hand that I ended up deleting 
commits and starting over. At this point, I wound up with two branches. I could not git push to the main branch, and the site 
would not deploy from the master branch. So I created a second folder and project on my device and pushed to a new repository 
where the site is deployed from. This working repo is GitHub.com/Clayto30/Horiseon_Home.

Please feel free to use the links to proceed to appropriate sections. Take a look at the CSS code. You'll find it's less 
repetitive and has the same functionality. 

Thanks for reading my readme file.

## Usage 
​
Click on the nav links to get to the sections. Improved accessibility includes ease of use for users utilizing a screen-reader. 
Please feel free to take a gander at the re-ordered CSS code with less repetition, and all the same function. Thanks for reading my README.
