## Description 
‚Äã
I scouted and improved the code and accessibility of the code for Horiseon's landing page.
‚Äã
## Table of Contents (Optional)
‚Äã
If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
‚Äã
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)

## Usage 
‚Äã
Click on the nav links to get to the sections. Improved accessibility includes ease of use for users utilizing a screen-reader. Please feel free to take a gander at the re-ordered CSS code with less repetition, and all the same function. Thanks for reading my README.
